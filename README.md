I wrote this website because I recently got back into Sudoku and my friend said my solving skills was very algorithmic, so I wondered if I would be able to program it into an app to use. I was able to build this in a day once I realized what I was doing. I had came up with a number of methods that boil down to random guessing and human methods, but evaluating the runtime of these algorithms wasn't particularly promising. I settled on a recursive backtracking algorithm that had runtimes well over 1000% faster than my previous methods. So a relatively modest improvement. 
Doing this project taught me a lot about Python, HTML, and JavaScript. I had minimal knowledge of each before this project. I have a better appreciation for the power of fullstack web development and am excited to create more projects in the future. 
If I could start over from the beginning, I would want to warn myself about the dangers of spaghetti code. My original implementation was convoluted and inefficient, so I'm glad I decided to look into other algorithms that better relied on the strengths of computers, particularly recursion.
I am not the only one who has made a Sudoku Solver, but I hope I can make mine relatively user-friendly, particularly for my mother, who was one of my clientele for this project.
